## Running of the Project
#### The project runs very smoothy with the API. One of the Downsides is that it highly depends on the live server and wether if it is getting a lot of traffic on it or not.

## Challenges
#### A major challenge during the project was the issue of scoping. It was hard to pull information intended for a url but being on an entirely different url. Fetching on the same click event resolved part of this issue.

## Learning
